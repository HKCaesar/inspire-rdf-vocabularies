# This is a draft RDF vocabulary for representing spatial data sets in INSPIRE as RDF. This vocabulary has been created using the "Guidelines for the RDF encoding of spatial data" (http://inspire-eu-rdf.github.io/inspire-rdf-guidelines).
#
# The use of RDF is optional and does not supersede or replace the requirements regarding encoding specified in Clause 9 of the INSPIRE Data Specifications. This optional encoding is intended to support the e-government and open data community in Europe, which is increasingly looking at RDF to represent data.
#
# This is a draft version. It has limitations and is expected to contain errors. Please report any issues or concerns in GitHub (https://github.com/inspire-eu-rdf/inspire-rdf-vocabularies/issues).
#
# ------------------------------
#
#
# This ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE "Buildings2D" application schema.
#
# The following properties have been encoded with global scope (see guidelines for further details):
#  - Building.geometry2D
#
# During the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:
# - Mappings:
#   - Property 'BuildingPart.geometry2D' is mapped to the global property 'geometry2D' from this ontology.
#
# - Alignments (through subsumption):
#   - Spatial object types are aligned with gsp:Feature.
#
# - Omissions: none
