# This ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE "Common Transport Elements" application schema.
#
# During the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:
# - Mappings:
#   - Code list and enumeration values are mapped to skos:Concept.
#   - The properties 'validFrom' and 'validTo' are mapped to the global properties defined by the base ontology.
#   - Geometry types are mapped to classes from the Simple Feature ontology.
#
# - Alignments (through subsumption):
#   - Spatial object types are aligned with gsp:Feature.
#   - Properties of spatial object types with value type 'GeographicalName' are aligned to property locn:geographicName.
#   - Properties with a geometry value type are aligned to locn:geometry and gsp:hasDefaultGeometry.
#
# - Omissions:
#   - Property 'inspireId' is omitted. See the guidelines for further details.
