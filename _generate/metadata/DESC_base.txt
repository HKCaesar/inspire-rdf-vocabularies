# This ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE "Base Types" and "Base Types2" application schemas.
# Additional classes implement types from the INSPIRE foundation schemas for which no suitable ontology representation has been identified yet.
#
# The following properties with global scope (see guidelines for further details) have been added to this ontology, for re-use by importing ontologies:
# - beginLifespanVersion
# - endLifespanVersion
# - validFrom
# - validTo
#
# During the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:
# - Mappings:
#   - Code list and enumeration values are mapped to skos:Concept.
#   - Type 'Identifier' is mapped to rdfs:Resource.
#   - Type 'SpatialDataSet' is mapped to dcat:Dataset.
#   - Type 'PT_FreeText' is mapped to rdf:langString.
#   - Type 'TM_Position' is mapped to time:TemporalPosition.
#
# - Alignments (through subsumption):
#   - Property 'Contact.address' is aligned to property locn:address.
#
# - Omissions:
#   - The types 'Identifier' and 'SpatialDataSet' have not been converted. They are mapped as described before.
#   - Property DocumentCitation.date has been omitted. A value for this property can be encoded using the DC-Terms properties 'created', 'issued', and 'modified'. See the guidelines for further details.
