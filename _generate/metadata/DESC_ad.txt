# This ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE "Addresses" application schema.
#
# During the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:
# - Mappings:
#   - Code list values are mapped to skos:Concept.
#   - The properties 'beginLifespanVersion', 'endLifespanVersion', 'validFrom', and 'validTo' are mapped to the global properties defined by the base ontology.
#   - Geometry types are mapped to classes from the Simple Feature ontology.
#
# - Alignments (through subsumption):
#   - Spatial object types are aligned with gsp:Feature.
#   - Type 'Address' is aligned with locn:Address.
#   - Type 'ThoroughfareNameValue' is aligned with gn:GeographicalName
#   - Properties of spatial object types with value type 'GeographicalName' are aligned to property locn:geographicName.
#   - Properties with a geometry value type are aligned to locn:geometry and gsp:hasDefaultGeometry.
#
# - Omissions:
#   - Property 'inspireId' is omitted. See the guidelines for further details.
#   - Property 'ThoroughfareNameValue.name' is omitted.
#   - Type 'AddressRepresentation' is omitted. Whenever this type is used as value type, then in the RDF encoding the RDF implementation of type 'Address' is used. For further details, see the guidelines.
#
# - Restructuring:
#   - Property 'GeographicPosition.default' is transformed into a new property 'defaultPosition' on class 'Address'.
