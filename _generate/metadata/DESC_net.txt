# This ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE "Network" application schema.
#
# The following properties have been encoded with global scope (see guidelines for further details):
#  - SimplePointReference.offset
#
# During the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:
# - Mappings:
#   - Code list values are mapped to skos:Concept.
#   - The properties 'beginLifespanVersion' and 'endLifespanVersion' are mapped to the global properties defined by the base ontology.
#   - Geometry types are mapped to classes from the Simple Feature ontology.
#   - Property 'SimpleLinearReference.offset' is mapped to the global property 'offset' from this ontology.
#
# - Alignments (through subsumption):
#   - Spatial object types are aligned with gsp:Feature.
#   - Properties of spatial object types with value type 'GeographicalName' are aligned to property locn:geographicName.
#   - Properties with a geometry value type are aligned to locn:geometry and gsp:hasDefaultGeometry.
#
# - Omissions:
#   - Property 'inspireId' is omitted. See the guidelines for further details.
